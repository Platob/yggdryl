//! The `yggdryl.local` namespace — the local-filesystem family: the lazy [`LocalIO`] single
//! access point and the raw memory-mapped [`Mmap`] it builds on.
//!
//! Mirrors `yggdryl_core::io::local`. [`LocalIO`] is one **lazy** handle over any path (file,
//! folder, or nothing yet) that decides per call how to serve I/O: constructing / probing /
//! navigating touches nothing, a read before any write opens the file ad hoc (a missing
//! node reads as empty), and the first write auto-creates the missing parent
//! folders + the file, memory-maps it, and keeps the mapping (`isMapped`) so later access
//! runs at memory speed. `close()` releases the mapping and the handle **stays usable** —
//! back to its lazy state. The same handle carries the filesystem graph — the `IOBase`
//! graph surface, mirrored from the core: `name` /
//! `parent()` / `join`, the **streamed** `ls(recursive?)` (a [`LocalEntries`] iterable) with
//! the collected `children()` convenience, and the shape-checked `rm()` / `rmfile()` /
//! `rmdir()` plus `mkdir()`.
//!
//! A `LocalIO` **directory node is a memory tree**: its `byteSize()` is the lazy streamed
//! sum of its subtree, and the ordinary byte surface (`pread*` / `pwrite*`) reads and
//! writes across its **name-sorted child file blocks** as one contiguous region (child
//! directories recurse; a middle block never grows — only the last block absorbs bytes
//! past the end, and a write into an **empty** directory throws the guided fix naming
//! `join a file name onto this directory`). DESIGN: the core's generic `tree_byte_size` /
//! `blocks` / `tree_pread_byte_array` / `tree_pwrite_byte_array` helpers are deliberately
//! **not** mirrored as named methods — they are the internal pattern behind that routing,
//! and the binding reaches the behavior through the ordinary byte surface on a directory
//! node.
//!
//! [`Mmap`] is the raw memory-mapped file `LocalIO` builds on (usable directly when a
//! pre-existing file and explicit control are wanted); it moved here from `yggdryl.memory`
//! with the core. It is a **leaf** of the IO graph — `name` is its file name, `ls()` /
//! `children()` stream and collect nothing, and `rm()` / `rmfile()` really unlink the
//! mapped file (`rmdir()` gives the guided file error). Every method on both classes is a
//! thin one- or two-line delegation to
//! `yggdryl_core` with no logic in the binding; the numeric idioms (byte-offset and length
//! **parameters** as `u32`, **returned** sizes / capacities / positions as `i64` — a JS
//! number, exact to 2^53 — and bit offsets as `i64` in both directions) match the
//! `yggdryl.memory` classes, and every failing operation surfaces as a thrown `Error`
//! carrying the core's guided text unchanged.

/// `yggdryl_core::io::local::LocalIO`:
///
/// - **Constructing / probing / navigating touches nothing.** `kind` / `exists()` /
///   `isFile()` / `isDir()` ask the disk per call; `join` / `parent()` are pure path math.
/// - **Reads pick their own path.** Before any write, a read opens the file ad hoc with one
///   positioned OS read (a missing node reads as empty; a directory reads as its memory
///   tree — see below). After the handle has written, reads are served from its
///   memory-mapped backing.
/// - **Writes auto-create and self-optimize.** The first write creates the missing parent
///   folders and the file, memory-maps it, and keeps the mapping (`isMapped` turns `true`).
/// - **The graph is the same handle.** Navigation, streamed discovery (`ls`, a
///   [`LocalEntries`] iterable) with the collected `children()`, and CRUD (`rm` / `rmfile` /
///   `rmdir` / `mkdir`) all live here.
/// - **A directory is a memory tree.** A directory node serves the *byte* contract too:
///   `byteSize()` is the lazy streamed sum of its subtree, and `pread*` / `pwrite*` route
///   across its name-sorted child file blocks as one contiguous region (child directories
///   recurse; a middle block never grows — only the last block absorbs bytes past the end).
///
/// `close()` releases the mapped backing eagerly (truncating the file to its logical
/// length) — unlike [`Mmap.close`](Mmap::close) the handle is **still usable** afterwards:
/// it simply returns to its lazy state. `copy()` yields a fresh lazy handle to the same
