# yggdryl — contributor & agent instructions

yggdryl is a Rust library with **Python (PyO3/maturin)** and **Node (napi-rs)** extensions.
Features are implemented in the Rust core first and mirrored, thinly, in both bindings.

## Scope — one abstract byte/memory-access layer, many sources

The core is the **`io` layer**: a single abstract byte-access contract (`io::memory::IOBase`,
with the concrete `IOCursor` / `IOSlice` wrappers and the in-heap `Heap` source), the root
`uri` family (`Uri` / `Url` / `Authority`) that **addresses** sources, the root `headers`
module (the one metadata map), and the cross-cutting value types at the `io` root (`IOMode`,
`IOKind`, `IoError`, `Whence`, the `Serializable` trait). Everything reads and writes through the one contract, so a new source (memory-mapped,
file, network, compressed, …) is written once and works everywhere.

From here the library scales up: absorb bytes from as many sources as possible behind this
single contract, then grow **typed data serialization** on top — a precise internal type
system, columns, and Arrow interop over these bytes — so ingestion is broad at the edge, the
representation is exact underneath, and everything downstream is fast. Arrow interop lives
behind the **opt-in `arrow` feature** (the core stays dependency-free by default); when the
feature is on, every internal type converts **to and from** its closest Arrow equivalent.

## Layout — one tree, mirrored everywhere

```

**The same folder tree is mirrored in code, tests, and benchmarks — in the core and in both
extensions.** This is a hard rule: a reader must find the same shape everywhere.

- *Core tests/benches* (flat by cargo's design) mirror by **path-derived names**:
  `src/io/memory/heap.rs` → `tests/io_memory_heap.rs` (+ `_alloc`) → `benches/io_memory_heap.rs`
  → `benchmarks/yggdryl-core/io/memory/heap.md`; `src/io/local/` → `tests/io_local_io.rs` +
  `tests/io_local_mmap.rs` (+ `_alloc`) → `benches/io_local_io.rs` + `benches/io_local_mmap.rs`
  → `benchmarks/yggdryl-core/io/local/{io.md,mmap.md}`; `src/uri/` → `tests/uri*.rs` →
  `benches/uri.rs` → `benchmarks/yggdryl-core/uri.md`; `src/headers.rs` → `tests/headers.rs`.
- *Bindings* mirror with **real folders**: `bindings/*/src/io/{memory.rs,local.rs,mod.rs,…}` +
  `bindings/*/src/{headers.rs,uri.rs}`,
  `bindings/python/tests/{io/test_memory.py,io/test_local.py,test_uri.py,test_headers.py}`,
  `bindings/node/test/{io/memory.test.js,io/local.test.js,uri.test.js}`, and the same under
  `benchmarks/` / `benchmark/`.
- *Public namespaces* mirror the **leaf modules identically in both bindings** —
  `yggdryl.memory`, `yggdryl.local`, `yggdryl.uri`, `yggdryl.headers`, and `yggdryl.io` for the
  io-root types — adapting only to
  platform nesting limits (napi namespaces are single-level, so both bindings stay flat and
  therefore identical).
- `docs/` pages mirror too (`docs/io/memory.md`, `docs/io/local.md`, `docs/uri.md`,
  `docs/headers.md`), each with synced
  `=== "Python"` / `=== "Node"` / `=== "Rust"` tabs, listed in `mkdocs.yml` nav.

Other top-level dirs: `.github/workflows/` — `ci.yml` (fmt/clippy/test + strict docs),
`docs.yml` (GitHub Pages), `release.yml` (version-bump-gated publish to crates.io/PyPI/npm).

## Adding a feature — the three languages move together

1. **Core first.** Implement in `yggdryl-core` with a `///` doc comment, a runnable
   **doctest**, and a unit test. All logic lives here.
2. **Thin bindings.** Mirror it in **both** extensions — each method is 1–2 lines delegating
   to `yggdryl_core`, **no logic in the binding**. Adapt only to idioms: Python dunders /
   keyword defaults; Node camelCase / `Option<T>` defaults. Error text passes through
   unchanged — the core `Display` becomes a Python `ValueError` and a Node thrown `Error`,
   reading identically.

   **Implement the most Python dunders the concept supports — always.** A value type gets
   `__eq__`, `__hash__` (only if immutable — a mutable one leaves `__hash__` unset, like
   `bytearray`), `__repr__`, `__str__` (when there's a canonical string), `__reduce__` so it
   pickles, and `__copy__` / `__deepcopy__` alongside `copy()`. Then every relevant
   *protocol*: a container is `__len__` + `__bool__`; anything map-like is `__contains__` /
   `__getitem__` / `__setitem__` / `__delitem__` / `__iter__` (like `dict` — including a type
   that *contains* a map, e.g. `Uri` over its params); a sequence/buffer is `__getitem__`
   (int **and** slice) + `__iter__` + `__bytes__`; an int-like enum is `__int__` + `__index__`.
   When in doubt, add the dunder. The Node side has no dunders — mirror the same capability as
   named methods (`equals`, `toString`, `get`/`set`/`has`/`delete`, `toBytes`, …).
3. **Test in all three.** Add a test on each surface; the three suites are the executable
   proof the APIs match method-for-method. A binding-visible change updates **both** bindings
   and their tests in the **same commit**.
4. **Document & measure.** Add or extend the mirrored `docs/io/<module>.md` page (synced
   three-language tabs; `mkdocs build --strict` stays green). For a performance-sensitive
   type, add a time+memory benchmark and a deterministic allocation check (see
   `benches/io_memory_heap.rs`, `tests/io_memory_heap_alloc.rs`, and the report under
   `benchmarks/yggdryl-core/`).

**A feature is not done until it is proven by all three of: a benchmark, edge-case tests, and
documentation code samples.** Every substantive feature ships (a) a **benchmark** measuring
both time and memory with a deterministic allocation check, (b) **tests covering the edges**
(empty, single, all-null, out-of-range, boundary widths, malformed input, the recursive/nested
case), and (c) **runnable documentation examples** graded **easy → complex** in the mirrored
`docs/` page's synced `=== "Python"` / `=== "Node"` / `=== "Rust"` tabs (the Rust tab a
compiling doctest, the binding tabs reproduced verbatim in the binding test suites). A change
that lacks any of the three is incomplete — do not consider it landed.

## Coding rules

- **Explicit type names in the Rust core; generic, type-inferring entry points in the
  bindings.** A core builder / typed accessor **names the concrete type it works over** —
  `parse_str`, `pread_i32` / `pwrite_i32`, `pread_byte_array`, `pread_utf8`, `IOMode::parse_str`
  — never an overloaded bare `parse` / `read` that hides which representation it takes. The
  bindings then expose **one generic method per concept** (`parse`, `read`, `copy`) that
  **infers the input's runtime type** and redirects to the matching explicit core builder.
- **Serializable, hashable, equatable — whenever possible.** Every public type that can carry
  a value implements the `io::Serializable` trait (`serialize_bytes` → `Vec<u8>` /
  `deserialize_bytes` — the exact inverse) plus `PartialEq`/`Eq` and `Hash` (skip `Hash` only
  for genuinely mutable buffers, which stay equatable by content). Mirror all three in **both**
  bindings — Python `__eq__` / `__hash__` / `__reduce__` (pickle) + the byte codec; Node
  `equals` / `hashCode` / `serializeBytes` / `deserializeBytes` — so every value works as a
  map key, in a set, and over a wire in every language. Keep **one identity: equal iff
  canonical bytes equal, and equal values hash equal**; build the canonical form once into a
  pre-sized buffer and stream it into the hasher (see `uri::Uri` / `HashWrite`).
- **Centralize metadata in `headers::Headers`.** There is exactly **one** metadata/annotation map
  type in the project: `Headers` (ordered, case-insensitive, multi-value, byte-capable). HTTP
  headers, schema/field metadata, source annotations — all of it is a `Headers`; never
  introduce a second map type or an ad-hoc `HashMap<String, String>` in a public signature.
  Every `IOBase` carries one (`headers()` / `headers_mut()`). The common single-valued keys — the
  content headers (`Content-Type`/`-Encoding`/`-Length`), the most-used HTTP request/response headers
  (`Host`, `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Authorization`, `Location`, `Connection`,
  `Cache-Control`, `Last-Modified`), and the storage keys (`X-Type-Id`, `X-Name`, `X-Mtime-Us`) — are
  **hard-typed struct fields** (`content_length()` → `u64`, `content_type()` / `host()` → `&str`, …
  read/write with no parse and no per-value allocation); every other name lives in the ordered
  multi-value overflow `Vec`.
  The generic map view (`get`/`get_bytes`/`iter`) still sees **everything** by returning a `Cow`
  (borrow for strings/overflow, a small render for the numeric keys). A promoted key is
  single-valued (append == replace) and a value that doesn't fit its typed field falls back to the
  overflow map — canonical order is the typed fields first, then the overflow, so equal maps
  serialize/hash equal.
- **Least reallocation, fewest copies — in every action.** Prefer zero-copy hand-off; never
  clone what a borrow can serve; pre-size every buffer you build (`with_capacity` /
  `encoded_len`); a bulk op ships an allocation-free *fill-into* / *read-into* counterpart
  (`pread_into`, `pread_i32_array`); bulk kernels stage through **fixed stack chunks**, not
  per-call heap buffers; **no allocations in hot loops**. Constructors take capacity when the
  caller knows it (`with_capacity` on every growable type, including via the `IOBase` trait).
  When a change claims a performance win, **prove it** — a benchmark on both time and memory,
  plus a deterministic allocation test.
- **A binding byte input is a borrowed buffer — never an owned `Vec<u8>`.** A method that takes
  bytes from Python/Node borrows the caller's buffer: Python **`PyBackedBytes`** (zero-copy for
  `bytes`, one copy for the mutable `bytearray`; both accepted), Node **`Buffer`** — each derefs
  to `&[u8]` and forwards it straight to the core. Never type a byte parameter `data: Vec<u8>`:
  pyo3 re-extracts a `bytes` **element by element** into an owned `Vec`, which alone cost ~5× on
  a 4.7 MiB compress before it was fixed, and silently crippled every bulk byte write. The core
  already takes `&[u8]`; the binding must not add a copy in front of it. (The native-codec speed
  the `zlib-rs` gzip/zlib backend buys is only visible once this boundary is zero-copy.)
- **Bulk operations are vectorized.** Typed bulk reads/writes (`pread_i32_array` /
  `pwrite_i64_array`, …) and repeated-value fills (`pwrite_i32_repeat`, …) run as **dense,
  branch-free loops over contiguous slices** so LLVM auto-vectorizes them on stable Rust (no
  SIMD dependency) — and a fill never materializes the full array. New sources inherit these
  from `IOBase`'s default methods; override only with something measurably faster.
- **Cross-platform first, platform-optimized underneath.** Every public API behaves
  **identically on every OS**; the same code runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Where a
  platform offers a faster route, **redirect to it behind `#[cfg(...)]`** (as `Mmap` does —
  `mmap`/`munmap` on unix, `CreateFileMappingW`/`MapViewOfFile` on windows — under one
  cross-platform surface), never fork the public behavior. A `#[cfg]` block always has an arm
  for **every** target (a portable `std` fallback is the last arm), and CI cross-checks unix on
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Paths are POSIX-normalized (`uri`), temp/home roots resolved from
  the environment — nothing hardcodes a separator or an absolute root.
- **Resolve shared instances once — never construct per call.** A registry, catalog, codec, or
  parsed constant that does not depend on the call's inputs is built **once** into a
  process-wide `LazyLock` static and reused (the `default_catalog()` mime registry, the
  `DEFAULT_URI`, the `stage_*` kernels). In the **bindings** this matters most: expose module
  singletons / cached factories so Python and Node do not re-instantiate a codec or re-seed a
  catalog on every call — resolve from the shared static and hand back a thin handle.
- **Content-changing io keeps its metadata in sync — optimally.** Any operation that changes a
  source's bytes (write past the end, `truncate`, in-place `compress`/`decompress`, a
  cross-source copy) **updates the affected `Headers`** in the same pass: `Content-Length` to
  the new byte size, `Content-Type` when the media changes (compress/decompress), and
  `mtime` (epoch µs) to now. Do it **without extra passes or allocations** — set the small
  header values inline (the alloc-free `set_mtime` render), only when the value actually
  changed, and never re-read the source to recompute what the operation already knows.
- **Metadata reads prefer the cached header.** Size / media-type / mtime accessors read the
  `Headers` value when present (it is authoritative and free) before probing the backing —
  a mapped `byte_size` is cheap, but a directory tree sum or a network `HEAD` is not, so a
  populated `Content-Length` short-circuits it.
- **A move is a copy that consumes its source — streamed, then removed.** `move_into(dst)`
  relocates a source's bytes into another `IOBase` and **removes the source at the end**,
  leveraging the same abstraction a cross-source copy does — **never** a re-read or an extra
  full-size buffer. It is a **no-op when source and destination address the same `uri`** (a
  move onto itself neither copies nor deletes). Prefer a **streamed** move — transfer in
  bounded chunks and, where the source can shrink cheaply (a `Heap`/`Mmap`/`LocalIO` that
  `truncate`s), **drop each chunk from the tail as it lands** so peak memory is one chunk, not
  the whole payload — then `rm` whatever backing remains. A source with no removable backing
  (a bare `Heap`) still moves its bytes and simply clears to empty.
- **Reads never fail on a missing source — they return empty.** A positioned byte read of a
  node that does not exist yet (a lazy `LocalIO` over an absent path, a `Heap` past its end)
  returns **zero bytes**, never an error — laziness means "not there yet", not "broken". Only
  the *typed* helpers with a hard fill contract (`pread_i32`, `pread_exact`) surface the guided
  `UnexpectedEof`, because they cannot fabricate the missing bytes. Every filesystem family
  inherits this: probing/navigating an absent node touches nothing and reads empty.
- **Every error names the fix.** An `IoError` (or any guided error) states the offending value,
  the expected range/tokens, **and** a short, concrete next step to fix it ("read fewer bytes
  or extend the data first", "enable the `compression` feature", "seek to a non-negative
  position"). Keep the fix hint short and imperative; the **same text** surfaces as a Python
  `ValueError` and a Node `Error`, so it must read well with no code around it.
- **`IOBase` is the central access path — bytes, address, and graph in one contract.** There
  is no separate path/graph trait: `IOBase` itself carries the graph surface — `ls` /
  `ls_recursive` **stream children of the same source type** (`Children` / `Walk` associated
  types; a leaf source declares `NoChildren`), `name` / `parent` navigate, `children` is the
  collected convenience, and `rm` / `rmfile` / `rmdir` remove (leaf default: a guided
  refusal). Discovery is **streamed** (iterators, never a pre-collected tree).
- **A container node is a memory tree.** A directory (or an object-store prefix) serves the
  *byte* contract too, through the generic `tree_*` defaults on `IOBase` — `tree_byte_size`
  (the lazy, streamed, uncached subtree sum), `tree_pread_byte_array` /
  `tree_pwrite_byte_array` (reads/writes routed across **name-sorted child blocks** as one
  contiguous region; child containers recurse; a middle block never grows — only the last
  block absorbs bytes past the end). The pattern is written **once** on `IOBase`; every
  filesystem family (local today, s3/azure/network later) wires its `byte_size`/`pread`/
  `pwrite` container branches to these same defaults so behavior is identical everywhere.
- **One access point per filesystem — lazy, auto-creating, self-optimizing.** Each
  filesystem family exposes exactly **one** handle type (`LocalIO` for local): a **lazy**
  node over any path — constructing/probing/navigating touches nothing, reads on a missing
  node are empty, and the handle **decides per call** how to serve I/O (ad-hoc positioned
  reads before any write; the first **write auto-creates** the missing parent folders + the
  file, memory-maps it, and keeps the mapping so later access runs at memory speed with zero
  allocations). Never split the surface into separate file/folder/path types — `mkdir`
  covers the folder-as-goal case and `close()` releases the optimized backing.
- **No lifetime parameters on public types** — the bindings must hold every one.
- **Coherent layering — the contract at the module root, implementations below.** Cross-cutting
  value types and traits (`IoError`, `Whence`, `Headers`, `IOMode`, `IOKind`, `Serializable`)
  live at the `io` root; the byte contract (`IOBase` + wrappers) at the `memory` root; each
  concrete **source** (`Heap`, `Mmap`) is one file below, implementing the trait's few
  required methods and inheriting the rest. A source depends **downward**, never sideways on a
  sibling source.
- **Ergonomic updates — `copy(**fields)` + `set_*` + `with_*`.** Every mutable public value
  type gets the trio: a `copy` that (where the idiom allows) takes an optional argument per
  settable field defaulting to the current value (Python kwargs / Node options object — the
  clone-with-overrides front door); an in-place `set_<field>`; a chainable `with_<field>`.
  Where combining whole values reads naturally, add `merge_with(other)` and domain combinators
  (`joinpath`). In the Rust core `copy` stays a plain clone and overrides chain via `with_*`.
- **Copy front door, `_in_place` fast path.** A transform that resizes or reinterprets a source's
  bytes ships as a **pair**: the **plain name returns a fresh copy** (the non-mutating front door —
  `resize_dtype`, `mask_filter`) and a **`_in_place`** twin **rewrites `self`** (reusing its
  auto-resizable backing, no extra copy — `resize_dtype_in_place`, `mask_filter_in_place`,
  `compress_in_place`). The copy is a thin `clone → _in_place`, so the in-place form is the single
  implementation and the two never drift. Both **pre-size every buffer to its known final length**
  (`with_capacity` / `vec![0; n]`) and grow a `String`/`Vec` once, never element-by-element.
- **The stored bytes have an element type.** A byte region interpreted as fixed-width values
  carries a [`datatype_id::DataTypeId`] in its `Headers` (`Type-Id`); `IOBase::dtype()` /
  `set_dtype()` read/write it, `element_count()` derives the count, `resize_dtype*` widens/shrinks
  between widths (numeric, saturating on narrowing), and the `Aggregate` trait's vectorized
  `sum`/`min`/`max`/`mean`/`std`/`first`/`last`/`count_ge` reduce over that dtype for every source.
- **One file per public type.** Mirror the nearest neighbour's structure, naming, error style,
  and doc style.
- **Minimize `Option`.** Only when absence is a real, distinct state a caller must handle.
  Prefer a total method with a sensible default (`Url::host()` → `""`), an empty collection
  over `Option<Vec<_>>`, two named methods over an `Option<bool>` flag, and a guided `Result`
  when absence is an error. Each `Option` in a public signature must justify itself.
- **Guided errors.** Every error names how to fix it (the expected range/tokens *and* the
  offending value, or the next step). Same text across Rust, Python, and Node.
- **Naming: `query` is the raw string; `params` is the map.** On `Uri`/`Url`, `query()` /
  `set_query()` address the raw query **string**, while `param` / `params` / `set_param` /
  `has_param` / … address the parsed key-value **map**. Apply the same split anywhere a raw
  form and a parsed map coexist.
- **`DataTypeId` is a categorized `u16` range — bands with reserved gaps, never a dense
  counter.** Ids are laid out in **per-category bands** (`0x00xx` special/bool, `0x01xx`
  integers, `0x02xx` floats, `0x03xx` decimals, `0x04xx` temporal, `0x05xx` byte/string,
  `0x06xx` nested), each band holding related types with **placeholder gaps** so a new width
  slots in beside its neighbours without renumbering. Every id belongs to exactly one
  [`DataTypeCategory`] (`category()`), and the predicates (`is_integer` / `is_float` /
  `is_decimal` / `is_binary` / `is_utf8` / `is_temporal` / `is_nested` / `is_variable_length` /
  `is_large` / …) are **bounded range checks against the band**, not long `matches!` lists.
  Adding a type means picking its band slot + wiring `from_u16` / `name` / `category` / the
  relevant predicate — never shifting an existing id.
- **Every internal type converts to and from its closest Arrow equivalent (feature `arrow`).**
  Behind the opt-in `arrow` feature, each level has a total, **zero-copy where possible**
  bridge: a `DataTypeId` (+ its field metadata) ↔ an Arrow `DataType`; a `Field` ↔ an Arrow
  `Field`; an `IOBase` byte region ↔ an Arrow `Buffer` (share the allocation, never re-copy);
  a `Serie` ↔ an Arrow `Array` (offsets + data + validity handed over, `bulk` and
  allocation-free on the hot path); a struct column ↔ an Arrow `StructArray` / `RecordBatch`
  and its schema ↔ an Arrow `Schema`. **When there is no exact Arrow match, map to the closest
  type and document the lossy edge** (e.g. a `FixedUtf8` → `FixedSizeBinary`, a `Decimal256`
  narrowing, an internal-only width → the nearest wider Arrow width) with a `// DESIGN:` note;
  the reverse direction restores the internal type from the field metadata. The bindings expose
  the bridge as a real interop surface (Python the Arrow **PyCapsule** interface for pyarrow;
  Node an Arrow **IPC** `Buffer` for apache-arrow).
- **Parsing is flexible at the edge, exact underneath.** A string→value parse accepts the
  **mainstream real-world formats** — a leading `+`, surrounding whitespace, scientific /
  exponent notation (`1.5e3`), thousands separators (`1,000,000` and locale `1_000`), a
  trailing/leading sign, `%`/currency-adjacent trimming where sensible, `inf`/`nan`, hex/binary
  integer prefixes — via a tolerant front door that **normalizes then delegates to the fast
  native parse**; once parsed, everything downstream runs on the internal **optimized**
  (vectorized, allocation-free) operations. Never hand-roll a slow per-char numeric loop where a
  normalize-then-`str::parse` (or a bulk kernel) serves. Keep the tolerant rules **common and
  documented** (add a mainstream format the moment a real input needs it), and the strict
  `*_exact` counterpart stays available for callers that want no coercion.
- **A node knows its graph — `parent()` / `children()` on `Field` / `Scalar` / `Serie`.** Every
  typed node exposes graph-discovery accessors so a caller navigates the tree from any node:
  `children()` streams the immediate child nodes (a leaf yields none; a `struct`/`list`/`map`
  yields its inner series/fields), `child(index)` / `child_by_name(name)` address one (recursing
  into sub-nodes for a dotted path), and mutation returns **`&mut` references that deep-mutate an
  inner series in place — no copy**. The pattern is the typed-layer mirror of `IOBase`'s
  `ls`/`parent` graph surface; nested containers are memory trees the same way a directory is.
- **Cast is field-driven — `cast_field(Field)` / `cast_field_in_place(Field)`.** A `Scalar` /
  `Serie` casts toward a **target `Field`**: it retypes the element dtype (via the byte layer's
  `resize_dtype` / a typed re-encode), applies the target **nullability** (widen to nullable, or
  drop the validity when the target is non-nullable and no nulls remain — else a guided error),
  the **name**, and any other `Headers` metadata — and is a **no-op when the field already
  matches** (skip the work). `Field` carries a `metadata()` / `metadata_mut()` accessor over its
  backing `Headers` so arbitrary annotations ride along. `Encoder`/`Decoder` gain the matching
  `encode_cast` / `decode_cast` helpers that convert through the target dtype on the fly.
- **Series carry element accessors + mutators — indexed and ranged, checked and `_checked`.** A
  `Serie` reads/writes one element (`get` / `set`, by index, as a `Scalar` **or** the native
  value) and a **range** (`get_range` / `set_range`, filled from a `Vec` or another `Serie`), each
  **type-checking** the incoming dtype and returning a guided error on mismatch; the **`*_checked`
  twin skips validation** for a caller that has already verified the dtype (the fast path), the
  same way the byte layer pairs a guarded op with its unchecked kernel. A bulk `set_range` is a
  dense, allocation-free copy, never element-by-element.
- **Non-nullable is the default; nullability is proven, not assumed.** A `Field` / `Headers`
  built without an explicit flag is **non-nullable** (`nullable = false`) — the common case, and
  the one the validity buffer can skip. A builder that ingests a collection with **no null
  values** stamps `nullable = false` in the metadata; only an actual null (a `None` / a
  `from_options` gap) makes a column nullable. Never default to nullable "to be safe" — an
  unneeded validity buffer is wasted memory and a lost fast path.
- **A `Field` always names itself — `name()` is non-nullable, defaulting to the dtype name.**
  When a field has no explicit name, `name()` returns the element type's token (`"i64"`,
  `"utf8"`, `"struct"`), never an empty string or `None`. The same total-accessor discipline as
  `Url::host()` — a caller never handles an absent name.
- **One `Any` type wraps every element type — keep it exhaustive.** The erased [`Any`] (id
  `X-Type-Id`-tagged) is the universal carrier over *all* types — leaf, byte, and nested. It
  backs the generic `get_any_value_at` / `get_any_scalar_at` / `set_any_scalar_at` accessors,
  which **redirect to the concrete type's optimized path** (never a slow per-element fallback),
  and the interpreting builders/factories. A cast **to** `Any` is a no-op (it already holds any
  type). **When you add a new element type you MUST extend `Any` (and `Column`, `Value`,
  `ColumnField`) in the same commit** — a type the erased carriers don't know is a latent panic.
- **Type conversion is isolated behind one pattern — logical over physical, any→any.** A
  **logical** type (decimal, utf8, temporal later) is a thin descriptor that **customizes, and
  overrides only where it can beat, the generic conversion to its physical storage** (decimal →
  its i32/i64/i128 unscaled buffer, utf8 → its offsets+data). Conversions live in **one place**
  (a `Convert`/`Cast` module, not scattered `if dtype ==` arms) so any-type → any-type is a
  single dispatch that reuses the existing **optimized physical** kernels (numeric `resize_dtype`,
  the byte offset copy, the bit pack) and stages through fixed stack chunks — never a scalar loop.
  Adding a type means adding its logical↔physical rule once; every conversion path picks it up.
- **Series grow and reshape through the memory layer, vectorized.** A `Serie` gains
  `with_capacity` (pre-allocate the exact backing when the size is known — proven by a benchmark),
  `append` / `extend` (from a `Vec`, another `Serie`, or a repeated value — one bulk copy, no
  per-element push), `mask_filter` (keep by a bool mask), `fill_null` (replace nulls with a value
  / forward-fill — used by field casting to satisfy a non-nullable target, with the validity
  check **skipped** when the column is already null-free), and the ordering ops `mask_sort` /
  `reverse`. Each runs as a **dense branch-free kernel over contiguous slices** (SIMD-friendly on
  stable Rust; a device override on a GPU-backed source), guided by the column metadata but doing
  the work on the raw bytes. Prove every one with a time+memory benchmark.
- **Aggregations over a `Headers`-carrying source take `use_cache: bool` and stay coherent.**
  A reduction on a source with a `Headers` may cache its result (a high-precision decimal in a
  promoted header, read/written through the typed accessor with no parse) and reuse it when
  `use_cache` is set; **any mutation clears the cached aggregate** in the same pass (the
  content-changing-io-keeps-metadata-in-sync rule), so a stale cache can never surface.
- **A container node addresses itself through its `Headers`, not a boxed field.** A source's
  address (its `uri`/`url`) lives in a **promoted hot header** (reuse the closest existing HTTP
  key — `Location` / `Host` — or a `X-Source-Uri` when none fits), so a `Heap`/source never stores
  a separate boxed `Uri`; the one metadata map holds it, read/written through the typed accessor.
- **A data format is a `DataIO` implementation, one crate per format.** The `io::DataIO` trait is
  the format contract: a `holder: IOBase` byte source, `field()` / `struct_field()` schema
  accessors, read/write **iterators of `StructSerie` and Arrow `RecordBatch`**, and a static
  `mime_type`. Each concrete format is its **own crate** (`yggdryl-ipc` for Arrow IPC first) that
  plugs any source in through the `IOBase` contract — **zero-copy streaming** where the format
  allows, never buffering the whole payload. Read/write **check field + types** and pair with a
  `*_checked` twin that skips the checks (and, on write, **casts to the DataIO's own schema when
  one is defined**). Prove the streaming path leverages `IOBase` with a benchmark.
- **The bindings move Arrow data through the C Data Interface / IPC, zero-copy.** Python uses the
  Arrow **PyCapsule** interface (`__arrow_c_array__` / `__arrow_c_schema__` / `__arrow_c_stream__`)
  so pyarrow imports with no copy; Node uses Arrow **IPC** buffers for apache-arrow. A nested
  series maps to **its own concrete serie**, not an opaque `ArrayRef` — rebuild to/from the Arrow
  equivalent with minimum allocations. Prefer the cdata/IPC hand-off over element marshalling for
  any bulk transfer.

## Toolchain (this environment is Windows)

- cargo at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` (on the PowerShell PATH); node at
  `C:\Program Files\nodejs`. Use **`uv`** for every Python action (venv, build, test).

## Gate before committing

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test                                    # default-members = core only (no Python/Node headers)
cargo test -p yggdryl-core --features arrow   # the Arrow interop bridge (feature-gated)
(cd bindings/python && uv run maturin develop && uv run pytest)
(cd bindings/node && npm run build && npm test)
uv run --no-project --with mkdocs-material mkdocs build --strict   # docs check
```

All must pass. Work on a **branch**; commit/push only when asked.

**Releasing** is by version bump: `release.yml` runs on every push to `main`, and whenever
`[workspace.package].version` has **no matching `v<version>` tag** it publishes to
crates.io / PyPI / npm and creates the `v<version>` tag + GitHub Release. So bump the version
**only** when you intend to release; keep it pinned during ordinary changes so the
auto-publish never fires mid-change.
